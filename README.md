String Vector Binary Search
Overview

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the binary search algorithm designed specifically for searching string vectors. The implementation includes a selection sort algorithm to efficiently sort the input vector before conducting the binary search.
Features

    Binary Search Algorithm: A robust binary search algorithm tailored for string vectors, enabling efficient search operations.
    Selection Sort: Implementation of the selection sort algorithm to ensure the input vector is sorted before conducting the binary search.
    User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface allowing users to input strings and perform searches easily.
    Educational Resource: Ideal for learning and understanding binary search and selection sort algorithms, particularly in the context of working with string data.

Usage

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/StrVecBinSearch.git

Compile the Code: Navigate to the cloned directory and compile the C++ source files using your preferred compiler. For example:

css

g++ -o main.exe main.cpp

Run the Program: Execute the compiled binary to run the program:

bash

./main.exe

Follow On-Screen Instructions: Enter first names when prompted, and input "zzz" to end the input sequence. Then, enter the name you want to search for. The program will display whether the name was found in the list.
